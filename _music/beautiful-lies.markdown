  lyrics_md: "Trying to change your mind is like the weather  \nAnd you don’t make
    my heart beat like you used to  \nI’ve been waiting for a sign  \nYou’ve been
    saving all your lines    \n\nWe could save each other for the better    \nAnd
    when you say my name I’ll be a memory  \nThis is more than we had planned  \nChoice
    is taken from our hands  \nFinally there’s space to stand alone  \n\nMy mind is
    a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you want to
    say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \nI feel these growing pains
    \ \nHave made us far too strong  \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre you
    there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nYou could lose yourself and search forever
    \ \nLooking for the person that you’ll never be  \nWe’ve been trying to compensate
    \ \nTime to learn from our mistakes  \n\nMaybe one day we’ll fit back together
    \ \nI’ll pick up the pieces and we’ll rearrange  \nNow we need to follow fate
    \ \nNow we look the other way  \nNow we find the strength to stand alone\n\nMy
    mind is a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you
    want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \nI feel these growing
    pains  \n\nHave made us far too strong  \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre
    you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nWe’ve been changing into something more
    \ \nFamiliar faces turning into stone  \nThese growing pains have made us far
    too strong  \nWe move along  \nWe move along  \n\nI find it’s too hard to breathe
    \ \nSay what you want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nMy
    mind is a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you
    want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \nI feel these growing
    pains  \nHave made us far too strong  \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre
    you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nMy mind is a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s
    too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell
    me are you there?  \nI feel these growing pains  \nHave made us far too strong
    \ \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?

    Woke up to the music of your heart\
    Saying aaaaah, aaaaah\
    Caught up in the wishing that it lasts\
    Saying aaaaah, aaaaah

    Only you ever make me scared\
    Coz only you can take me there

    So wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    Desert to ice flow\
    I will follow\
    Wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    I’m your shadow

    There beneath your body when it wakes\
    Saying aaaaah, aaaaah\
    Hiding under every step you take\
    Saying aaaaah, aaaaah

    Only you ever make me care\
    Coz only you ever made me dare

    So wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    Desert to ice flow\
    I will follow\
    Wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    I’m your shadow\
    I’m your shadow

    I know, I know, I know\
    Everywhere you move\
    You stay, you go, you change\
    I am bound to you

    So wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    Desert to ice flow\
    I will follow\
    Wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow

    So wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    Desert to ice flow\
    I will follow\
    Wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    I’m your shadow

    Someone told me\
    That I’ll want more\
    That I’ll feel half empty\
    Ripped and torn\
    They say there’ll be plenty\
    Other hands to hold\
    Now I wish they’d told me\
    Long ago

    Oo, I don’t want this to break you\
    Oo, but I’ve got no one else to talk to

    I don’t know if you mean everything to me\
    And I wonder can I give you what you need\
    Don’t want to find I’ve lost it all\
    Too scared to have no one to call\
    So can we just pretend\
    That we’re not falling into the deep end

    You’ve gone quiet\
    You don’t call\
    And nothing’s funny\
    Anymore\
    And I’ll keep trying\
    To help you heal\
    I’ll stop you crying\
    And dry your tears

    Oo, I don’t want this to break you\
    Oo, but I’ve got no one else to talk to

    I don’t know if you mean everything to me\
    And I wonder can I give you what you need\
    Don’t want to find I’ve lost it all\
    Too scared to have no one to call\
    So can we just pretend

    Oo,\
    How do we mend?\
    Oo,\
    I didn’t choose to depend\
    On you,\
    It’s out of our hands\
    Maybe it’ll work out in the end

    I don’t know if you mean everything to me\
    And I wonder can I give you what you need\
    Don’t want to find I’ve lost it all\
    Too scared to have no one to call\
    So can we just pretend

    Don’t know if you mean everything to me\
    And I wonder can I give you what you need\
    Don’t want to find I’ve lost it all\
    Too scared to have no one to call\
    So can we just pretend\
    That we’re not falling into the deep end

    I’m a dreamer\
    But it’s hard to sleep\
    When your head’s not in it\
    I’ve been restless\
    Coz you disappeared\
    And there’s something missing

    The earth is loose\
    Under my shoes

    There’s an angel\
    And he’s shaped like you\
    And I thought I knew him\
    There’s a window\
    And it’s dark inside\
    where the light was in it

    This can’t be love\
    If it hurts so much\
    I need to let go

    I will survive\
    And be the one who’s stronger\
    I will not beg you to stay\
    I will move on\
    And you should know I mean it\
    Wild horses run in me

    I remember\
    How we danced so close\
    I would stand on your feet\
    And the phone calls\
    That would last all night\
    They were life boats to me

    Our fading scars\
    Just shooting stars\
    They’re here then gone

    I will survive\
    And be the one who’s stronger\
    I will not beg you to stay\
    I will move on\
    And you should know I mean it\
    Wild horses run in me

    Our human hearts\
    Forget how strong they are\
    And they get lost along the way\
    It’s not giving up\
    It’s letting go\
    And moving to a better place\
    I will survive

    And be the one who’s stronger\
    I will not beg you to stay\
    I will move on\
    And you should know I mean it\
    Wild horses run in me

    I will survive\
    And be the one who’s stronger\
    I will not beg you to stay\
    I will move on\
    And you should know I mean it\
    Wild horses run in me

    Give a little time to me\
    Give a little trust and you’d see\
    Give a little piece of mind\
    You never know what you might find

    Oh if this is what dreams are made on\
    Then I think that I’ve seen enough\
    Oh I’ve given you all of my love\
    But it’s still not enough

    You told me that you’d light my way\
    You're clever with the words you say\
    Led me out into the dark\
    I took a little step too far

    Oh if this is what dreams are made on\
    Then I think that I’ve seen enough\
    Oh I’ve given you all of my love\
    But it’s still not enough

    Oh it hurts\
    Lost control\
    Oh it hurts\
    Lost it all\
    It hurts sometimes\
    Sometimes

    If this is what dreams are made on\
    Then I think that I’ve seen enough\
    Oh I’ve given you all of my love\
    But it’s still not enough

    A bitter heart\
    You let me down\
    But you’ll never lose\
    What you never found

    There are shadows in my dreams\
    Storms that steer me out of reach\
    And you just wait on my defeat

    So I built an army underneath\
    And now they guard me while I sleep\
    And this worn out frame will carry me

    Don’t go holding your breath\
    You know that I’m not done yet\
    There’s still a fight in me left\
    Don’t go shouting out loud\
    That you’re claiming the crown\
    I’m down but not out

    And the bittersweet\
    Of every new defeat\
    Is I’m stronger that before\
    Maybe on my knees\
    But I still believe\
    These broken wings will soar

    Untie my silhouette\
    It’s all that is left\
    Of a broken heart\
    Leave all of my regrets\
    To sink like ship wrecks\
    Through oceans dark

    In the dust I wrote my name\
    And from the ruins hopes were raised\
    Coz all that’s lost can be replaced\
    In time

    Don’t go holding your breath\
    You know that I’m not done yet\
    There’s still a fight in me left\
    Don’t go shouting out loud\
    That you’re claiming the crown\
    I’m down but not out

    And the bittersweet\
    Of every new defeat\
    Is I’m stronger that before\
    Maybe on my knees\
    But I still believe\
    These broken wings will soar

    Untie my silhouette\
    It’s all that is left\
    Of a broken heart\
    Leave all of my regrets\
    To sink like ship wrecks\
    Through oceans dark

    Untie my silhouette\
    It’s all that is left\
    Of a broken heart\
    Leave all of my regrets\
    To sink like ship wrecks\

    Bound to this lonely road\
    You gave me hope\
    Gave me hope\
    Woke my drifting soul\

    Fallen so far\
    Said you’d watch over my heart\
    Your love was so real\
    Too late to forget how you made me feel

    Tell me what I was supposed to believe\
    Held me so close I could hardly breathe\
    And now I can’t find how to let you go\
    You were mine but you’ve gone so cold

    Say it’s all in my head\
    I remember when you said\
    I’ll never let you go\
    Held me in the dark\
    Sheltered as you took my heart\
    I could never let you go

    Say it’s all in my head\
    Remember when you said\
    I’ll never let you go\
    Hold me in the dark\
    Shelter as you take my heart\
    Take my heart

    Kiss me pretend\
    Tell me all your love lies again\
    Cast your shadows\
    Like how you said you’d catch me\
    But let me go

    You said I could’ve been free if I wanted to\
    I know you could see I was lost in you\
    Said you’d let me be if I wanted you to\
    And I know you’ll leave but I don’t want you to

    Say it’s all in my head\
    I remember when you said\
    I’ll never let you go\
    Held me in the dark\
    Sheltered as you took my heart\
    I could never let you go

    Say it’s all in my head\
    Remember when you said\
    I’ll never let you go\
    Hold me in the dark\
    Shelter as you take my heart\
    Take my heart

    So take my heart\
    For your love\
    I let you break apart every piece of me\
    so take my heart\
    It’s all that’s left

    Take my heart

    Say it’s all in my head\

    Some mistakes\
    Are harder to recover from\
    And I miss the days\
    I could take my make up and put a brave face on

    Oh my beautiful summer\
    How the winter makes me wonder\
    Where you’ve gone

    Oh my beautiful summer\
    How the winter makes me wonder\
    Where you’ve gone

    Every night when the sun goes down\

    Hear you calling me\

    There’s no such thing as a perfect life\
    Oh and I let it die\

    Where you’ve gone

    Oh my beautiful lover\
    We were perfect for each other\
    I was wrong
