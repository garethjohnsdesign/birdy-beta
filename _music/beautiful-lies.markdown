  lyrics_md: "Trying to change your mind is like the weather  \nAnd you don’t make
    my heart beat like you used to  \nI’ve been waiting for a sign  \nYou’ve been
    saving all your lines    \n\nWe could save each other for the better    \nAnd
    when you say my name I’ll be a memory  \nThis is more than we had planned  \nChoice
    is taken from our hands  \nFinally there’s space to stand alone  \n\nMy mind is
    a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you want to
    say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \nI feel these growing pains
    \ \nHave made us far too strong  \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre you
    there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nYou could lose yourself and search forever
    \ \nLooking for the person that you’ll never be  \nWe’ve been trying to compensate
    \ \nTime to learn from our mistakes  \n\nMaybe one day we’ll fit back together
    \ \nI’ll pick up the pieces and we’ll rearrange  \nNow we need to follow fate
    \ \nNow we look the other way  \nNow we find the strength to stand alone\n\nMy
    mind is a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you
    want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \nI feel these growing
    pains  \n\nHave made us far too strong  \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre
    you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nWe’ve been changing into something more
    \ \nFamiliar faces turning into stone  \nThese growing pains have made us far
    too strong  \nWe move along  \nWe move along  \n\nI find it’s too hard to breathe
    \ \nSay what you want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nMy
    mind is a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you
    want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \nI feel these growing
    pains  \nHave made us far too strong  \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre
    you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nMy mind is a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s
    too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell
    me are you there?  \nI feel these growing pains  \nHave made us far too strong
    \ \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?

    Woke up to the music of your heart\
    Saying aaaaah, aaaaah\
    Caught up in the wishing that it lasts\
    Saying aaaaah, aaaaah

    Only you ever make me scared\
    Coz only you can take me there

    So wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    Desert to ice flow\
    I will follow\
    Wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    I’m your shadow

    There beneath your body when it wakes\
    Saying aaaaah, aaaaah\
    Hiding under every step you take\
    Saying aaaaah, aaaaah

    Only you ever make me care\
    Coz only you ever made me dare

    So wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    Desert to ice flow\
    I will follow\
    Wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    I’m your shadow\
    I’m your shadow

    I know, I know, I know\
    Everywhere you move\
    You stay, you go, you change\
    I am bound to you

    So wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    Desert to ice flow\
    I will follow\
    Wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow

    So wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    Desert to ice flow\
    I will follow\
    Wherever you go\
    I’m your shadow\
    I’m your shadow

    Someone told me\
    That I’ll want more\
    That I’ll feel half empty\
    Ripped and torn\
    They say there’ll be plenty\
    Other hands to hold\
    Now I wish they’d told me\
    Long ago

    Oo, I don’t want this to break you\
    Oo, but I’ve got no one else to talk to

    I don’t know if you mean everything to me\
    And I wonder can I give you what you need\
    Don’t want to find I’ve lost it all\
    Too scared to have no one to call\
    So can we just pretend\
    That we’re not falling into the deep end

    You’ve gone quiet\
    You don’t call\
    And nothing’s funny\
    Anymore\
    And I’ll keep trying\
    To help you heal\
    I’ll stop you crying\
    And dry your tears

    Oo, I don’t want this to break you\
    Oo, but I’ve got no one else to talk to

    I don’t know if you mean everything to me\
    And I wonder can I give you what you need\
    Don’t want to find I’ve lost it all\
    Too scared to have no one to call\
    So can we just pretend

    Oo,\
    How do we mend?\
    Oo,\
    I didn’t choose to depend\
    On you,\
    It’s out of our hands\
    Maybe it’ll work out in the end

    I don’t know if you mean everything to me\
    And I wonder can I give you what you need\
    Don’t want to find I’ve lost it all\
    Too scared to have no one to call\
    So can we just pretend

    Don’t know if you mean everything to me\
    And I wonder can I give you what you need\
    Don’t want to find I’ve lost it all\
    Too scared to have no one to call\
    So can we just pretend\
    That we’re not falling into the deep end

    I’m a dreamer\
    But it’s hard to sleep\
    When your head’s not in it\
    I’ve been restless\
    Coz you disappeared\
    And there’s something missing

    The earth is loose\
    Under my shoes

    There’s an angel\
    And he’s shaped like you\
    And I thought I knew him\
    There’s a window\
    And it’s dark inside\
    where the light was in it

    This can’t be love\
    If it hurts so much\
    I need to let go

    I will survive\
    And be the one who’s stronger\
    I will not beg you to stay\
    I will move on\
    And you should know I mean it\
    Wild horses run in me

    I remember\
    How we danced so close\
    I would stand on your feet\
    And the phone calls\
    That would last all night\
    They were life boats to me

    Our fading scars\
    Just shooting stars\
    They’re here then gone

    I will survive\
    And be the one who’s stronger\
    I will not beg you to stay\
    I will move on\
    And you should know I mean it\
    Wild horses run in me

    Our human hearts\
    Forget how strong they are\
    And they get lost along the way\
    It’s not giving up\
    It’s letting go\
    And moving to a better place\
    I will survive

    And be the one who’s stronger\
    I will not beg you to stay\
    I will move on\
    And you should know I mean it\
    Wild horses run in me

    I will survive\
    And be the one who’s stronger\
    I will not beg you to stay\
    I will move on\
    And you should know I mean it\
    Wild horses run in me

    Give a little time to me\
    Give a little trust and you’d see\
    Give a little piece of mind\
    You never know what you might find

    Oh if this is what dreams are made on\
    Then I think that I’ve seen enough\
    Oh I’ve given you all of my love\
    But it’s still not enough

    You told me that you’d light my way\
    You're clever with the words you say\
    Led me out into the dark\
    I took a little step too far

    Oh if this is what dreams are made on\
    Then I think that I’ve seen enough\
    Oh I’ve given you all of my love\
    But it’s still not enough

    Oh it hurts\
    Lost control\
    Oh it hurts\
    Lost it all\
    It hurts sometimes\
    Sometimes

    If this is what dreams are made on\
    Then I think that I’ve seen enough\
    Oh I’ve given you all of my love\
    But it’s still not enough

    A bitter heart\
    You let me down\
    But you’ll never lose\
    What you never found

    There are shadows in my dreams\
    Storms that steer me out of reach\
    And you just wait on my defeat

    So I built an army underneath\
    And now they guard me while I sleep\
    And this worn out frame will carry me

    Don’t go holding your breath\
    You know that I’m not done yet\
    There’s still a fight in me left\
    Don’t go shouting out loud\
    That you’re claiming the crown\
    I’m down but not out

    And the bittersweet\
    Of every new defeat\
    Is I’m stronger that before\
    Maybe on my knees\
    But I still believe\
    These broken wings will soar

    Untie my silhouette\
    It’s all that is left\
    Of a broken heart\
    Leave all of my regrets\
    To sink like ship wrecks\
    Through oceans dark

    In the dust I wrote my name\
    And from the ruins hopes were raised\
    Coz all that’s lost can be replaced\
    In time

    Don’t go holding your breath\
    You know that I’m not done yet\
    There’s still a fight in me left\
    Don’t go shouting out loud\
    That you’re claiming the crown\
    I’m down but not out

    Through oceans dark

    Untie my silhouette\

    Of a broken heart\

    Fallen so far\
    Said you’d watch over my heart\
    Your love was so real\
    Too late to forget how you made me feel

    Tell me what I was supposed to believe\
    Held me so close I could hardly breathe\
    And now I can’t find how to let you go\
    You were mine but you’ve gone so cold

    Say it’s all in my head\
    I remember when you said\
    I’ll never let you go\
    Held me in the dark\
    Sheltered as you took my heart\
    I could never let you go

    Say it’s all in my head\
    Remember when you said\
    I’ll never let you go\
    Hold me in the dark\
    Shelter as you take my heart\
    Take my heart

    Kiss me pretend\
    Tell me all your love lies again\
    Cast your shadows\
    Like how you said you’d catch me\
    But let me go

    You said I could’ve been free if I wanted to\
    I know you could see I was lost in you\
    Said you’d let me be if I wanted you to\
    And I know you’ll leave but I don’t want you to

    Are harder to recover from\

    Just pretend we’re better\

    There are no more surprises to come\
    Let’s be numb together

    The world’s so fast\
    That nothing lasts\
    Let’s save it while we can

    Like smoke in the air\
    Float like a feather, going nowhere

    Lost in the silence\
    I don’t need to be free\
    Kill me with kindness and please

    Tell me beautiful lies\
    I wish that I had the strength to let go\
    But I don’t\
    I’m paralysed\
    I see the child in your eyes\
    And I'm stuck in the headlights

    I know too well\
    That time will tell\
    It’s easy to forget

    Coz I want to be forever\
    Like smoke in the air\

    Kill me with kindness and please,

    Oh well I’ve tried to be open\
    But I’ve found it’s hard when you’re broken\
    And in the heat of the moment we’re free

    So please, please, please

    Tell me beautiful lies\
    Cover my eyes with your hands\
    Just pretend we’re better\
    Turn out the light\
    There are no more surprises to come\

    Just as much as me

    It’s so cold, baby it’s dark outside\
    Winter comes creeping in through the night\
    And it’s hard when I just want to hold you tight\
    Breaks my heart but nothing can break this ice

    Hold on, hold on, Baby just be strong

    And I will be honest and let you go\
    This is the reason and you should know\
    Through all that you promise I can see\
    None of your dreams ever have time for me\
    So this is the reason I let you go\
    I will be honest and you should know\
    Through all that you promise, I can see\
    None of your dreams ever have time for me

    And it’s so quiet, baby it’s hard to breathe\
    Black as ink, the silence is deafening\
    And it’s so hard to look into distant eyes\
    and feel your heart slowly tie away from mine

    So long, so long, baby you’re long gone

    And I will be honest and let you go\
    This is the reason and you should know\
    Through all that you promise I can see\
    None of your dreams ever have time for me\
    So this is the reason I let you go\
    I will be honest and you should know\
    Through all that you promise, I can see\
    None of your dreams ever have time for me

    None of your dreams\
    Take me with you\
    None of your dreams\
    Let me love you\
    None of your dreams\
    Take me with you\
    Take me with you

    None of your dreams\
    Take me with you\
    None of your dreams\
    Let me love you\
    None of your dreams\
    Take me with you\
    Take me with you

    **Repeat**

    None of your dreams\
    Take me with you

    I find myself\
    In these four walls\
    Wishing for somewhere else\
    I’ve lost myself\
    Like this before\
    Calling out for your help

    All the times I won’t believe\
    Yours’ll be the voice that is on my shoulder\
    All the things you’ve said to me\
    Written on my heart every word you’ve spoken

    I know you, you’ll never\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Even when, I let you\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Oh,\
    When I’m out of place\
    And I’m losing faith\
    You’re the one that never lets me run\
    You’ll never, give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me

    Inside my head\
    I’ve been at war\
    Trying to find some peace\
    If you can see\
    An open door\
    Teach me how to be free

    All the times I won’t believe\
    Yours’ll be the voice that is on my shoulder\
    All the things you’ve said to me\
    Written on my heart every word you’ve spoken

    I know you, you’ll never

    Give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Even when, I let you\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Oh,\
    When I’m out of place\
    And I’m losing faith\
    You’re the one that never lets me run\
    You’ll never, give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me

    Till you get here\
    I’ll be holding on, holding on\
    You always know the words\
    To make me strong, make me strong

    I know you, you’ll never\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Even when, I let you\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Oh,\
    When I’m out of place\
    And I’m losing faith\
    You’re the one that never lets me run\
    You’ll never, give up on me

    I know you, you’ll never\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Even when, I let you\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Oh,\
    When I’m out of place\
    And I’m losing faith\
    You’re the one that never lets me run\
    You’ll never, give up on me\
    Give up on me\
    Give up on me

    Tidal wave, tidal wave\
    Take it all, take it all\
    And I don’t care anymore

    You can lie, all you like\
    All it’s done is make me fight\
    And shake the truth inside my soul

    I’m tired, pretending\
    Keep my beliefs suspended\
    Coz underneath

    I’m starting to wake from silent sleep\
    I’m starting to break and I can grieve\
    I’m starting to see that I know how\
    To love, to lose, to work it out\
    I’m starting to heal and find some faith\
    I’m starting to feel what’s out of place\
    Don’t need you to save me I can’t wait\
    To fall, to fade and start again

    Hurricane, hurricane\
    Take it all, take it all\
    Spin me round and back again

    You can talk, you can talk\
    All it’s done is start a war\
    With nothing really to defend

    I’m tired, pretending\
    Keep my beliefs suspended\
    Coz underneath

    I’m starting to wake from silent sleep\
    I’m starting to break and I can grieve\
    I’m starting to see that I know how\
    To love, to lose, to work it out\
    I’m starting to heal and find some faith\
    I’m starting to feel what’s out of place\
    Don’t need you to save me I can’t wait\
    To fall, to fade and start again

    To start again\
    To start again

    I’m starting to wake from silent sleep\
    I’m starting to break and I can grieve\
    I’m starting to see that I know how\
    To love, to lose, to work it out\
    I’m starting to heal and find some faith\
    I’m starting to feel what’s out of place\
    Don’t need you to save me I can’t wait\
    To fall, to fade and start again
