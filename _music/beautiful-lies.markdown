  lyrics_md: "Trying to change your mind is like the weather\\\nAnd you don’t make
    my heart beat like you used to\\\nI’ve been waiting for a sign \\\nYou’ve been
    saving all your lines\n\nWe could save each other for the better\\\nAnd when you
    say my name I’ll be a memory\\\nThis is more than we had planned \\\nChoice is
    taken from our hands\\\nFinally there’s space to stand alone\n\nMy mind is a runaway
    \\\nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe\\\nJust say what you want to say \\\nAre
    you there?\\\nTell me are you there?\\\nI feel these growing pains \\\nHave made
    us far too strong \\\nWe’ll change if you want to change \\\nAre you there?\\\nTell
    me are you there?\n\nYou could lose yourself and search forever\\\nLooking for
    the person that you’ll never be\\\nWe’ve been trying to compensate\\\nTime to
    learn from our mistakes \n\nMaybe one day we’ll fit back together \\\nI’ll pick
    up the pieces and we’ll rearrange \\\nNow we need to follow fate \\\nNow we look
    the other way\\\nNow we find the strength to stand alone\n\nMy mind is a runaway
    \\\nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe\\\nJust say what you want to say \\\nAre
    you there?\\\nTell me are you there?\\\nI feel these growing pains \n\nHave made
    us far too strong \\\nWe’ll change if you want to change \\\nAre you there?\\\nTell
    me are you there?\n\nWe’ve been changing into something more\\\nFamiliar faces
    turning into stone\\\nThese growing pains have made us far too strong\\\nWe move
    along\\\nWe move along \n\nI find it’s too hard to breathe\\\nSay what you want
    to say \\\nAre you there?\\\nTell me are you there?\n\nMy mind is a runaway \\\nAnd
    I find it’s too hard to breathe\\\nJust say what you want to say \\\nAre you there?\\\nTell
    me are you there?\\\nI feel these growing pains \\\nHave made us far too strong
    \\\nWe’ll change if you want to change \\\nAre you there?\\\nTell me are you there?\n\nMy
    mind is a runaway \\\nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe\\\nJust say what you
    want to say \\\nAre you there?\\\nTell me are you there?\\\nI feel these growing
    pains \\\nHave made us far too strong \\\nWe’ll change if you want to change \\\nAre
    you there?\\\nTell me are you there?"
