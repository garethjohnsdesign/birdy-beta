  lyrics_md: "Trying to change your mind is like the weather  \nAnd you don’t make
    my heart beat like you used to  \nI’ve been waiting for a sign  \nYou’ve been
    saving all your lines    \n\nWe could save each other for the better    \nAnd
    when you say my name I’ll be a memory  \nThis is more than we had planned  \nChoice
    is taken from our hands  \nFinally there’s space to stand alone  \n\nMy mind is
    a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you want to
    say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \nI feel these growing pains
    \ \nHave made us far too strong  \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre you
    there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nYou could lose yourself and search forever
    \ \nLooking for the person that you’ll never be  \nWe’ve been trying to compensate
    \ \nTime to learn from our mistakes  \n\nMaybe one day we’ll fit back together
    \ \nI’ll pick up the pieces and we’ll rearrange  \nNow we need to follow fate
    \ \nNow we look the other way  \nNow we find the strength to stand alone\n\nMy
    mind is a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you
    want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \nI feel these growing
    pains  \n\nHave made us far too strong  \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre
    you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nWe’ve been changing into something more
    \ \nFamiliar faces turning into stone  \nThese growing pains have made us far
    too strong  \nWe move along  \nWe move along  \n\nI find it’s too hard to breathe
    \ \nSay what you want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nMy
    mind is a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you
    want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \nI feel these growing
    pains  \nHave made us far too strong  \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre
    you there?  \nTell me are you there?  \n\nMy mind is a runaway  \nAnd I find it’s
    too hard to breathe  \nJust say what you want to say  \nAre you there?  \nTell
    me are you there?  \nI feel these growing pains  \nHave made us far too strong
    \ \nWe’ll change if you want to change  \nAre you there?  \nTell me are you there?
